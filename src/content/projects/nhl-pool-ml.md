# Machine Learning for the Best NHL Pool

This project combines data science, machine learning, and optimization algorithms to create the ultimate NHL fantasy pool team.

## Project Overview

The goal was to develop an intelligent system that can predict NHL player performance and build the optimal fantasy team using advanced algorithms.

## Key Features

### Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **NHL API Integration**: Automated extraction of player statistics and performance data
- **Data Cleaning**: Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline to handle missing values and outliers
- **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful features from raw NHL statistics

### Machine Learning Models
- **Performance Prediction**: Trained models to predict current season points for NHL players
- **Model Selection**: Evaluated multiple algorithms to find the best performing approach
- **Validation**: Implemented robust cross-validation to ensure model reliability

### Optimization Algorithm
- **Branch-and-Bound**: Implemented sophisticated algorithm to find the optimal team composition
- **Constraint Handling**: Managed salary cap, position requirements, and roster constraints
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensured efficient execution for real-world usage

## Technical Stack

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models
- **NHL API**: Real-time player data
- **Branch-and-Bound Algorithm**: Custom optimization implementation

## Results

The system successfully predicts player performance and generates optimal team lineups that consistently outperform manual selections, providing a significant advantage in fantasy NHL pools.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time updates during the season
- Integration with multiple fantasy platforms
- Advanced injury prediction models
- Player value trend analysis
