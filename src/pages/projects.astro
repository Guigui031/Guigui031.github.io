    title="Metadata curation to evaluate the use of LLMs in the context of a systematic review"
    img="/ProjetCurationMetadonnees.png"
    desc="This project is about collecting metadata from articles in systematic reviews to create clean datasets. The developped program performs automatic data cleaning, definition, and alignment for all these articles. The datasets are used by a Mila-affiliated M.Sc. student to evaluate the use of LLMs in the screening phase of systematic review."

    title="Kaggle Competition on Text Classification"
    img="/KaggleCompetition.svg"
    desc="Not knowing the context and only having a Bag-of-Words matrix, we needed to predict the binary labels of new documents. We developped a small architecture to organize our submissions and our best model was an Ensemble Learning Classifier using a NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier, an XGBoost Classifier and a SVM Classifier."

    desc="This project evaluates and compares various text classification systems capable of identifying paraphrases between sentences, testing the robustness of the models on the QQP and MRPC datasets from the GLUE corpus. Furthermore, the project explores whether biased training can lead to biased performance and experiments with different encoders to identify the most performant and generalizable ones."
